### PCB Components

This folder has Symbols, Footprints and 3D Models that are only for this project.

PCB footprint antenna belongs to https://github.com/prasad-dot-ws
and I'm unsure to use it in this design because it does not show the compensated circuit.
This RF tunning needs to be made per board. Is not something you can just copy and paste around.
