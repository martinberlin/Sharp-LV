# SHARP Light and Versatile controller

The goal of this PCB is to make a small SHARP memory in pixel (MIP) controller
All this might change as the idea develops but initially the plan is the following:

- DS3231 or RV2032 acting as RTC to generate the Squarewave required by this displays
- Optional touch only available in eBay from a seller in the UK (Better use 1.1 version)
